.TH emo 7 2015-2-27 "Revision 0.1" "The Emoticon Guide"

.SH
DESCRIPTION

.P
This is a collection of emoticons and emoji commonly used in text-based
communication, particularly via e-mail or IRC. Particular care is taken to
include all common connotations of emoticons, to help the reader decipher
complicated or ambiguous emotions.

.SH
INSTALLATION

.P
On UNIX systems, this document can be installed so that it is accessible with
man(1):

.RS
$ cd emo/

$ export MANDIR="..." # defaults to /usr/share/man/

$ sudo make -e install

$ sudo make -e uninstall
.RE

.P
It can then be accessed with the traditional

$ man emo
.RE

.SH
BASIC

.P
These emoticons generally consist of two characters. The first, generally a
colon (:) or a semicolon (;) represent a pair of eyes, while the second
represents a mouth.

Note, however, that some variants of these emoticons contain more characters. (See COMMON VARIANTS)

Finally, some smileys are reversible due to the symmetry of the constituent
characters. In such cases, the most commonly-used orientation (generally
eyes-first) is used.

.IP :)
Perhaps the most basic emoticon listed. Conveys happiness, contentment,
gratitude, etc.

.IP :(
Conveys sadness, disappointment, and misery.

.IP ;)
Like a wink. Indicates that some positive information was left unsaid, but that
based on context the reader should be able to derive this information.

.IP :P
Indicates that the preceding remark was humerous, sarcastic, or otherwise
lighthearted and not meant to be taken seriously.

.IP :D
Conveys gladness, extreme joy, sudden excitement, etc.

.IP D:
Conveys sudden disappointment, sadness, devastation, etc.

.IP :/
Conveys uncertainty about a situation. Indicates doubt or confusion.

.IP ":O or :o"
Conveys surprise, but not necessarily a positive or negative reaction.

.IP "B) or BD"
Indicates that the speaker feels a certain degree of "coolness" after
having said the preceding remark.

.IP XD
Conveys that the speaker found a recent remark extremely amusing.

.IP :3
The 'kitty face'. Conveys a cat-like feeling of happiness.

.IP c:
Conveys a heightened sense of happiness, joy, etc.

.IP :c
Conveys a heightened sense of sadness, sudden disappointment, etc.

.IP :|
Conveys indifference or mild annoyance.

.IP ">:) or >:D or >:3"
Conveys a sense of devious happiness or 'evil laughter'.

.IP >:|
Conveys moderately high annoyance.

A cross of XD and :P.

.IP :'(
Conveys crying.

.\" TODO: \o/ and variants, <3, ^_^ and variants

.SH
COMMON VARIANTS

.IP ":))))))))), :DDDDDDD, :((((((((, etc"
Repeated mouths can indicate stronger emotions (or just compulsive typists).

.IP "xD, xP, Xp, etc"
The capitalization of an emoticon can change as long as the overall look of the emoticon stays essentially the same.

.IP ":-), :-(, ;-), etc"
A hyphen (-) character between the eyes and mouth of an emoticon represents a nose.

.SH
NOTE ON PARENTHESES

.P
The usage of parenthesis-terminated emoticons within parenthsized statements
merits some discussion.  There are several possible conventions which can be
used.

We can optimize for grammatical correctness by placing an additional closing
parenthesis after the emoticon:

.RS
(I like it the way it is. :))
.RE

However, this looks awkward to many. The alternative is to leave off the
trailing parenthesis:

.RS
(I like it the way it is. :)
.RE

This, however, appears incomplete and is not strictly correct. A compromise can
be achieved by placing a space between the two parentheses:

.RS
(I like it the way it is. :) )
.RE

In general, it is left to the writer to choose a style which they prefer.
