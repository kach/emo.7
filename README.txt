emo(7)                        The Emoticon Guide                        emo(7)



DESCRIPTION
       This is a collection of emoticons and emoji commonly used in text-based
       communication, particularly via e-mail or IRC. Particular care is taken
       to  include  all  common  connotations of emoticons, to help the reader
       decipher complicated or ambiguous emotions.


INSTALLATION
       On UNIX systems, this document can be installed so that it is  accessi-
       ble with man(1):

              $ cd emo/

              $ export MANDIR="..." # defaults to /usr/share/man/

              $ sudo make -e install

              $ sudo make -e uninstall


       It can then be accessed with the traditional

              $ man emo


BASIC
       These  emoticons generally consist of two characters. The first, gener-
       ally a colon (:) or a semicolon (;) represent a pair of eyes, while the
       second represents a mouth.

       Note, however, that some variants of these emoticons contain more char-
       acters. (See COMMON VARIANTS)

       Finally, some smileys are reversible due to the symmetry  of  the  con-
       stituent  characters. In such cases, the most commonly-used orientation
       (generally eyes-first) is used.


       :)     Perhaps the most basic emoticon listed. Conveys happiness,  con-
              tentment, gratitude, etc.


       :(     Conveys sadness, disappointment, and misery.


       ;)     Like  a  wink. Indicates that some positive information was left
              unsaid, but that based on context the reader should be  able  to
              derive this information.


       :P     Indicates  that the preceding remark was humerous, sarcastic, or
              otherwise lighthearted and not meant to be taken seriously.


       :D     Conveys gladness, extreme joy, sudden excitement, etc.


       D:     Conveys sudden disappointment, sadness, devastation, etc.


       :/     Conveys uncertainty about a situation. Indicates doubt or confu-
              sion.


       :O or :o
              Conveys  surprise,  but  not  necessarily a positive or negative
              reaction.


       B) or BD
              Indicates that the speaker feels a certain degree of  "coolness"
              after having said the preceding remark.


       XD     Conveys  that  the speaker found a recent remark extremely amus-
              ing.


       :3     The 'kitty face'. Conveys a cat-like feeling of happiness.


       c:     Conveys a heightened sense of happiness, joy, etc.


       :c     Conveys a heightened sense of  sadness,  sudden  disappointment,
              etc.


       :|     Conveys indifference or mild annoyance.


       :<     Conveys anger or moderate annoyance.


       :x     Conveys nervousness or slight embarrassment at something said.


       >:) or >:D or >:3
              Conveys a sense of devious happiness or 'evil laughter'.


       >:|    Conveys moderately high annoyance.


       >:(    Conveys anger, disappointment, resent, fury.


       XP     A cross of XD and :P.


       :'(    Conveys crying.



COMMON VARIANTS
       :))))))))), :DDDDDDD, :((((((((, etc
              Repeated  mouths can indicate stronger emotions (or just compul-
              sive typists).


       xD, xP, Xp, etc
              The capitalization of an emoticon can  change  as  long  as  the
              overall look of the emoticon stays essentially the same.


       :-), :-(, ;-), etc
              A hyphen (-) character between the eyes and mouth of an emoticon
              represents a nose.


NOTE ON PARENTHESES
       The  usage  of  parenthesis-terminated  emoticons  within  parenthsized
       statements  merits some discussion.  There are several possible conven-
       tions which can be used.

       We can optimize for grammatical correctness by  placing  an  additional
       closing parenthesis after the emoticon:

              (I like it the way it is. :))

       However,  this  looks  awkward to many. The alternative is to leave off
       the trailing parenthesis:

              (I like it the way it is. :)

       This, however, appears incomplete and is not strictly correct.  A  com-
       promise can be achieved by placing a space between the two parentheses:

              (I like it the way it is. :) )

       In general, it is left to the writer to choose a style which they  pre-
       fer.
